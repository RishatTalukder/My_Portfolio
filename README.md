# My_Portfolio

This is my first Attemp to make a portfolio website. I've never Done something like this and I'm Hoping to make a good design using `Tailwind` or `BootStrap`. For _BackEnd_ I'll use <code><bold>Djnago</bold></code>.

**so lets go!!!**

# Backend Installation

We can divide this into two parts:

1. Bootstrap/Tailwind(FrontEnd)
2. Django(BackEnd)

We will not start from design but from the BackEnd. So lets start with Django. Because as i've learned that

> When you know what you are working with you will know how to design that.

SO, Django Backend is the feature of the project and we will start with that.

## Django Installation

So, to work with django and python we need to install python first. So, lets install python first:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (go to this link and download the latest version of python)

- I'm using `python 3.11.5`

After installing python we need to make a `virtual environment` for our project, so lets do that.

> A `virtual environment` is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated python virtual environments for them. This is one of the most important tools that most of the Python developers use.

So, open Your terminal and type:

- <code>python -m venv <bold>environment_name</bold></code>(replace `environment_name` with your environment name)

- I named my environment `py_env`.

Now, You'll see a folder was created automatically with the name you gave your environment. There are THousands of files inside that folder. You Don't need to worry about that. 

Now, we need to `Activate` our environment. So, type:

- `environment_name\Scripts\activate` (replace `environment_name` with your environment name)

For exapmle: `py_env\Scripts\activate`

Now everything you install with `pip` will be installed in this environment and not in your global environment.

Now, we need to install `Django` in our environment. So, type:

- `pip install django`

Django will be installed in your environment. Im using `Django 4.2.5`.

You can check your django version by typing, `python -m django --version`.

Now, our environment is setup and we can start our project.


# Djnago Project Setup

Step 1: Make a directory for your project. I named my directory `My_Portfolio` and cut the `enviroment` folder and paste it in `My_Portfolio` directory.

Step 2: Open the directory in your terminal and type:

- `django-admin startproject <project_name> .` (replace `project_name` with your project name)

for example: `django-admin startproject portfolio .`

> `django-admin` is Djangoâ€™s command-line utility for administrative tasks.

> `startproject` is a command that creates a folder with the name you gave and some files inside that folder, that are necessary for a django project.

> Note: The `.` at the end of the command is important. It tells the startproject command to install Django in your current directory.

After the command is executed you will see a folder named after the project name you gave. In my case it is `portfolio` and a python file named `manage.py`.

> `manage.py` is the most important file in a django project. Its used to do almost everything in a django project. SO, Don't edit or modify it ever.

Now, lets get to now the files and folders inside the `portfolio` folder.

Here, the portfolio folder is the `root` directory of our project. i'll call it `root` to avoid any confusion. It contains the following files and folders:

```
|-- root
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- asgi.py
|   |-- settings.py
|   |-- urls.py
|   |-- wsgi.py
```

- `__init__.py` is an empty file that tells python that this directory is a python package.

- `asgi.py` is the entry point for ASGI-compatible web servers to serve your project.

- `settings.py` is the file where you will store all the configuration for your project.

- `urls.py` is the file where you will store all the urls of your project.

- `wsgi.py` is the entry point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve your project.

Now, lets run our project and see if everything is working fine. So, in the terminal, type:

- `python manage.py runserver` (this will run your project in your local server)

You see something like this:

- in the terminal:
<img src="images_and_stuff/django_server.PNG"
     alt="Markdown Monster icon"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

- in the browser:
<img src="images_and_stuff/django_starting_page.PNG"
     alt="Markdown Monster icon"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />


So if you see this, then your project is running fine. Now, lets stop the server by pressing `ctrl+c` in the terminal.

We made our project and now we need to make an app for our project. So, lets do that.


# Creating an App

Before making an app we need to know what we want to add in our project by that app.

As, this is a portfolio website, you need to add your `projects`, `skills`, `about` and `contact` information. So, we will make an app for each of them, Most importantly We need a Home page for our website. which is the First task to complete in any website. So,lets make an app for that.

SO, open up your terminal and type:

- `python manage.py startapp <app_name>` (replace `app_name` with your app name)

> `startapp` is a command that creates a folder with the name you gave and some files inside that folder, that are necessary for an app.
